1:49AM - Bacolod City, PH (~~S-E-MRJ~~)

Back in 2017, during some downtime while on a bouldering trip in Japan I read Peter Thiel's book Zero to One. 

During this period of my life I was pushing 4 years working for a local startup and my life was getting a bit stagnant -- I had been promoted a couple of times and was no longer challenged by my web engineering job. 

I remember feeling inspired by Thiel's writing -- his talk about bringing novel ideas into the world, about creating technologies and startups. The one thing I remember reading was Thiel saying (greatly paraphrased), "If I was a younger man, I'd be working in artificial intelligence. A lot of exciting stuff is happening there."

I flew back to Manila with a feeling of great purpose, an impossible mission to break into the field of artificial intelligence.

It initially did feel impossible given I was pretty bad at math and had no experience whatsoever. But this feeling of "impossibility" energized me rather than discouraged me, and I set out to find a way I could learn. 

I reached out to old college professors who I knew did some research in "classical" (sorry) machine learning but to no avail. So I went online to find classes and stumbed on Andrew Ng's excellent Machine Learning class.

I remember making Anki cards for machine learning concepts and going through lessons multiple times because I couldn't understand the math. 

I eventually was able to get accepted into some free albeit selective machine learning bootcamps - one was sponsored by the Philippine government and was meant more for academics or those with PhD's, another by a Wave Computing (cofounded by [Dado Banatao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_Banatao), no less!) expanding its operations to the Philippines.

I recall a lot of feelings of "suck" because it was so hard for me to grasp but also feelings of elation that I was creeping up the steps toward my impossible goal.

Fast forward to 2019 -- after many days of frustration while learning the ropes, I eventually got my foot in the door as a Data Engineer in [Thinking Machines](https://thinkingmachin.es/) building web scrapers and data pipelines. I remember hacking after-hours with a colleague on some demos with [BERT](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/), creating a chatbot interface where you'd feed a link to an article into it and you could ask questions about it.

We demoed it to a big client in Singapore and I got reassigned to a project using NLP to classify scientific articles and semantically search their contents. Eventually I was promoted to Machine Learning Product Engineer and achieved my goal of professionally working on machine learning products and the engineering of its related components. 

My colleague and I were slated to move to Singapore to help start a branch of the company there - the move was coupled with relocation benefits and a much fatter salary - but that fell through when COVID hit in 2020.

I was pretty much shattered though that took a while to fully sink in -- probably the entirety of 2020. I hid away in Baguio, hosted by my brother and his family, staying there for a good 3 months.

There I met an old colleague from the aforementioned local startup I worked at prior. He casually mentioned a startup I might be interested in that he had invested in and a year later, I reached out to the CEO and found a new job consulting for an AI startup in the US. I was elated since it was the first time I was earning a salary that large.

I worked there for a year, hacking like my life depended on it and eventually standing in for the CTO since he was on leave to care for his ailing parents. I got to experience hiring, building and managing my own team and directing the major demos we were showing to investors which we eventually wanted to turn into projects (one cool one was finding stocks that would be thematically correlated to a query. Think: companies related to lithium batteries or [GameStop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze)).

For a reason I wont get into here, I ended up leaving.

It was pretty crushing to me since I loved my team and I felt I gave the company my all. Once again I found myself afloat at sea. 

I'm still figuring things out and slowly moving in a generally good direction but that's not the point of this story.

### Fragility of Goals

I've been reflecting on the ups and downs of that journey. 

Having the big hairy audacious goal of breaking into AI really gave me a ton of fuel and something to wake up to everyday. 

It took me a good 2 years and reaching it gave me a high like no other - but once I achieved it I found myself lost as I scrambled to find another worthy goal.

I find this pattern repeats itself quite frequently in my life: before breaking into AI it was working at a tech startup, before that it was getting good at programming, before that it was "being cool" in college (lol). 

I'll get super excited about a goal, direct all my attention towards it, achieve it, be happy for a while, then feel lost.

It's a fragile happiness and I often wonder if this cycle is just part of being human. I've always been curious to know how one can achieve lasting happiness.  

### Hedonia

> Hedonia: striving to experience pleasure, enjoyment, and comfort 

I'm slightly ashamed to say the next goal I gravitated towards was making money. It wasn't really out of greed. It was perhaps born more out of necessity and a bit of insecurity.

When I worked at Thinking Machines, I rented a tiny condo to be closer to work so I could be at the office and work more (seriously...) and I found that I had something like Php 10,000 - the equivalent of around $200 USD - left in my bank account after paying my advance on the rent.

I was a bit frustrated to learn that my peers were making more than me and had way more saved up while I had nothing to show despite my hard work.

I made good progress on this goal after a year working for that US startup since I earned in dollars and was paid US rates. During this time, I also moved out of Manila to a house in Santa Rosa, an hour south of the metro, which cost 1/4 of what I was previously spending in rent (double [geographic arbitrage](https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/money/saving/geographic-arbitrage) ftw!) . Because of COVID as well, I didn't really eat out much and if I did it was in Santa Rosa prices. This really allowed me to save.

I got to experience things I couldn't before like eating in fancy restaurants, driving a fast car and traipsing around a few Asian countries for a month - it was fun but I didn't really feel fulfilled.

I'm not so naive as to say that money doesn't matter. It does. You need it for your basic necessities, to pursue your hobbies, handle emergencies, help people. Money gives you more options and when used wisely can help further other goals. 

While money can actually buy happiness if you know how to use it, that happiness isn't lasting. 

There's this theory called the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) which basically says no matter how much you increase your cash flow, how many shiny toys you buy or how many trips you take around the world, you'll eventually return to your baseline level of happiness.

### The Pursuit of Eudaimonia

While wealth-building is worthwhile and responsible (saving for the future is always smart!) I really don't think it should ever be one's sole goal. I'd rather view it as an accelerator or mulitplier for other goals or better yet, a purpose.

I'm still in the middle of learning about living what Aristotle calls "the good life" or _Eudaimonia_.

> Eudaimonia: the pursuit of virtue, excellence, and the best within us

An expanded definition I like is from a book my aunt recommended to me, [The Power of Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30008950-the-power-of-meaning):

> Leading a _eudaimonic_ life requires cultivating the best qualities within you both morally and intellectually and living up to your potential. It is an active life, a life in which you do your job and contribute to society, a life in which you are involved in your community, a life, above all, in which you realize your potential, rather than squander your talents.

In this blog I hope to write about my journey figuring out how to live a _eudaimonic_ life. 

I want to determine my purpose, reflect on what it means to be virtuous, find my community, find ways I can contribute to society in my own way, explore ways to hone my craft and pursue excellence in my sport and chosen field.

While I don't have a clear idea yet of where all this is going, setting out on this adventure truly excites me.

Stay tuned!
