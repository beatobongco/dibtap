This isn't a post about saving our dying planet, nor is it a post about humanity going to Mars. <!-- excerpt-end -->

This is more in the context of self-improvement and investing time (and money).

### Planting trees

They say the best time to plant a tree is yesterday (or 5 years ago - or however long it takes for the tree to fully mature). The same can be said about good habits and investing - the longer you've been exposed the more return on investment. For example, a lifetime of daily exercise would mean you're probably quite fit right now. A lifetime of daily meditation may mean your mind is sharp and clear as hell or it has at least given you some respite from your noisy monkey mind. Investing in some land years ago means it's probably grown quite a bit in value. Being in your career for a long period of time means you've probably learned to do a thing or two quite efficiently or you've made some interesting connections in the space.

That's why focusing on building good habits has been part of my journal entries for the longest time. It's also been a great source of frustration as I notice daily entries chastising myself for not executing consistently. 

As long as there's drive to eventually get them right it's enough. After all, there's more value in the lifelong desire for self-improvement and the willingness to get back on the horse than actually ever attaining a "perfect state". What is "perfect" anyway? Attaining a perfectly consistent state where nothing changes means you're not really growing.

The times I've really gotten close to completing my daily habits or I've really stayed invested in a thing was when I had an overarching purpose. Purpose gives energy.

### Launching rockets

What does all this have to do with launching rockets though? I'm no rocket scientist but I would imagine that if you want to launch a rocket straight to the moon and you mistakenly position the rocket even a degree off-center it could end up in another planet altogether after a several hundred kilometers.

Knowing your destination matters else if you go full-blast in any direction you might realize years later you were going the wrong way and you could end up farther from your goal than you even started.

Humans are notoriously bad at long-term planning / prediction. I forget where exactly I first read it (must have been an economics book) but I recall even experts fare [quite badly](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/worst-tech-predictions-of-the-past-100-years-c18654211375/) when you ask them to extend their predictions even a few years out. The longer the timespan you try to project your predictions, the worse your success rate gets. 

You don't really need to know exactly where you're going but you do need some vague direction in which to orient your rocket.

For example, I'm not exactly sure where I should be headed now career-wise, what with AI threatening to automate us out of jobs (and create [new ones](https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/)) or with the looming [global recession](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/09/15/risk-of-global-recession-in-2023-rises-amid-simultaneous-rate-hikes).

But what I do know is wherever I'm going, I do want to be an excellent software engineer. So even if I don't know which company I ultimately want to work for, what major problem I want to solve (maybe AI ethics?), or what kind of startup I want to eventually create -- that's OK. I can just focus on getting ready for when I find out by trying my best to be excellent where I currently am. 

There's a lot of value in stopping to reflect from time to time and course correcting when the information you have changes or new information is revealed to you. At least that's what Thomas Bayes and I [believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).

### Taoism?

It's good to think about planting trees and launching rockets but maybe not too much.

Too much thinking about the future can give one anxiety. It's just as bad as thinking too little about it and ending up having your future decided for you by parents, peer pressure or just randomness.

I've recently been reading a bit about Taoism but I'm far too early in the journey to share anything of consequence. What I did understand though is maybe not to worry too much and enjoy the process. 

To pick a direction perhaps and just "go with the flow". Find what you enjoy, stick with it and see what new information or opportunities come up during your journey. Maybe trust yourself that you'll know something good when you see it and have the courage to go for it.

I hope to learn about Taoism a bit more. Or maybe not. Let's just see where the winds of this blog take me.
