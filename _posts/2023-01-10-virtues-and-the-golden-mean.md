10:00AM - Makati City, PH (S-E-~~MRJ~~)

I grew up, as many Filipinos do, in a traditional Catholic household. I have a deeply religious mother. Through grade school and high school I went to an institution run by nuns and priests.

One thing that frustrated me about my religious education was we were taught to prepare ourselves for the ultimate end - for our actions here on earth to be judged as either fit for heaven or not. 

I always had an issue with that. Did that mean all the nice people I was interacting with were only nice because they wanted to get into heaven and avoid hell?<!-- excerpt-end --> Goodness was just a means to an end to avoid the pain of an eternity in an inferno tortured by demons. (What an image to put in the mind of a wee child...)

I had issue of how much time these rituals took, how strict the requirements were to be a good Catholic and how little I learned in sermons on how to live a good life.

It seemed like there was a lot of shame involved, being humble, meek and forgiving. Turning the other cheek. Eschewing riches since "it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven". 

I went through a phase of radical self-improvement in high school. I started working out reguarly, read lots of self-help books and began to put myself out there by joining organizations and contests and applying for schools and scholarships.

I became a lot more ambitious when I entered college and I began to see who I wanted to become was not compatible with what virtues I grew up being taught.

I lost my spirituality but I actually felt happier because I also lost feelings of guilt and being held back by dogma I didn't agree with. 

I've only recently been occupied by finding some sort of spirituality. 

For the longest time my core desire was to improve myself because I could sense that the more I improved myself, the happier I got. So I formed a personal life philosphy where I would endeavor to become my best self.

I had a naive fantasy: imagine there is a multiverse. In each of universe where my starting conditions were the same (same parents, place of birth, starting attributes) I wanted to make the decisions that would give me the "best" outcome of all. Becoming the "prime" version of myself. 

As I get older, I realize that it is a pretty childish fantasy, but a useful one nonetheless as it spurred me to continually self-improve. It has a major problem though in that how does one define the "best" outcome? According to whom?

According to me, this version of me in this universe. 

(I know this is nebulous -- different versions of me might argue that since they are each the judge of their own definitions of "best", their life is the best among all. But part of this thought experiment is imagining meeting another version of yourself - let's say one that chose to study this or that or move to another country. Would I imagine that I would feel more in awe of that other version of myself?)  

What makes me the "best" version of myself is still something I am trying to define - so I'm enlisting the help of much smarter people who came before me. 

Aristotle's idea of _eudaimonia_ resonates with the above childish fantasy of mine. I will never be able to travel the multiverse, so all I can judge is myself in this universe.

I am finding his writing gives me a clearer idea of how to judge whether I am living up to my potential.

### Aristotle on Virtues

Central to _eudaimonia_ is the practice of virtues.

But what are virtues? 

(These are what I have gathered from my reading - so it may not be 100% accurate. But I'll share my reflection anyway.)

Aristotle argues that to achieve "human flourishing", humans must live according to the pursuit of something that is an end in and of itself. 

(Money, for example, is just a means to an end. Happiness is an end in and of itself.) 

Just as a dog is happiest doing dog things (e.g. playing fetch or digging as a standin for hunting), humans are happiest doing human things. But what does it mean for a human to be doing human things?

Aristotle argues that only humans have reason, so a human's purpose is to be rational, and virtues are just humans practicing rationality so virtues are the pursuit of what it means to be human. It is an end in and of itself.

Aristotle provides an elegant tool to define virtues: the [Golden Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)).

Here he argues that virtues are just the mean of two vices, and vices are just extremes.

For example, having too little courage is cowardice and having too much courage is rashness. 

An example situation I came across is to imagine an old lady is being mugged. If you have too little courage, you would ignore what is happening and run away. If you have too much courage, you might rush in and try to incapacitate the mugger and save the old lady.

At first glance, it seems having too much courage is a good thing. But consider: if the mugger has a knife or a gun, or is much stronger than you, your efforts might be futile and you might just be putting yourself and the old lady in unnecessary danger. You might even make the situation worse by escalating it: the mugger might have only planned to take the old lady's purse and run but since you tried to tackle him (and maybe the old lady helps you), he pulls out his gun and shoots both you and the old lady.

A better approach would maybe be to call for help. There might be bystanders who are more capable that you could work with. Or might try calling the police on your phone.

We must use our rationality and knowledge of ourselves to find that midpoint.  

If virtues are defined as thus and they are central to achieve eudaimonia does it mean the ultimate virtue is "balance"?

The spirit of the Golden Mean also appears in many religions and philosophies so it's very interesting that a lot of thinkers have converged on this idea:

* The myth of Daedalus and Icarus, an inscription on the temple at Delphi and Cleobulus, Socrates and Plato talked about this idea before Aristotle.
* Buddhism: Gautama Buddha: the "Middle Way"
* Judaism: Ecclesiastes 7:15-16: "be not righteous over much", "be not over much wicked"
* Christianity: Saint Thomas Aquinas: "...it is evident that moral virtue observes the mean"
* Islam: Muhammad: "the best choice is the middle ground/golden mean one"
* Hinduism: Bhagavad Gita: "Yoga is not for one who eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough."

I like this idea a lot because it always seemed to be that the things I was taught growing up was skewed too much to one side. 

I want to be a charitable person but not have to give everything and live in squalor. I want to be nice to people but not be stepped on. I want to achieve great things and not feel bad about telling people about it (I'm not talking about bragging. Many times in life it is very useful to be able to communicate your value. For example, during an interview.)

I like the idea of using rationality, and not some old doctrine to determine the best way to be. 

I think by being the "best" version of yourself as defined by being virtuous: balanced and rational, you have the capacity to help more people and maybe even inspire them.
