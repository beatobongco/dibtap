10:00AM - Makati City, PH (S-E-~~MRJ~~)

I grew up, as many Filipinos do, in a traditional Catholic household. I have a deeply religious mother. Through grade school and high school I went to an institution run by nuns and priests.

One thing that frustrated me about my religious education was we were taught to prepare ourselves for the ultimate end - for our actions here on earth to be judged as either fit for heaven or not. 

I always had an issue with that. Did that mean all the nice people I was interacting with were only nice because they wanted to get into heaven and avoid hell?<!-- excerpt-end --> Goodness was just a means to an end to avoid the pain of an eternity in an inferno tortured by demons. (What an image to put in the mind of a wee child...)

I had issue of how much time these rituals took, how strict the requirements were to be a good Catholic and how little I learned in sermons on how to live a good life.

It seemed like there was a lot of shame involved, being humble, meek and forgiving. Turning the other cheek. Eschewing riches since "it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven". 

I went through a phase of radical self-improvement in high school. I started working out reguarly, read lots of self-help books and began putting myself out there by joining organizations and contests and applying for schools and scholarships.

I became a lot more ambitious when I entered college and I began to see who I wanted to become was not compatible with what virtues I grew up being taught.

I lost my spirituality but I actually felt happier because I also lost feelings of guilt and being held back by dogma I didn't agree with. 

I've only recently been occupied by finding some sort of spirituality. 

For the longest time my core desire was to improve myself because I could sense that the more I improved myself, the happier I got. So I formed a personal life philosphy where I would endeavor to become my best self.

I had a naive fantasy: imagine there is a multiverse. In each of universe where my starting conditions are the same (same parents, place of birth, other starting attributes) I wanted to make the decisions that would give me the "best" outcome of all. Becoming the "prime" version of myself. 

As I get older, I realize that it is a pretty childish fantasy, but a useful one nonetheless as it spurred me to continually self-improve. It has one major problem: how does one define the "best" outcome? Best according to whom?

According to me, of course! The version of me in this universe! 

(I know this is nebulous -- different versions of me might argue that since they are each the judge of their own definitions of "best", their life is the best among all. But part of this thought experiment is imagining meeting another version of yourself - let's say one that chose to study this or that or move to another country. Would I imagine that I would feel more in awe of that other version of myself?)  

What makes me the "best" version of myself is still something I am trying to define - so I'm enlisting the help of much smarter people who came before me. 

Aristotle's idea of _eudaimonia_ resonates with the above childish fantasy of mine. I will never be able to travel the multiverse, so all I can judge is myself in my current universe.

I am finding that his writing gives me a clearer idea of how to judge whether I am living up to my potential.

### Aristotle on Virtues and the Golden Mean

Aristotle argues that humans must pursue the highest good and that the highest good must be something that is an end in itself. 

Money, for example, is just a means to an end. Anything you buy with it is just what you think will make you happy. Happiness is an end in itself. Thus happiness must be the highest good. 

Central to Aristotle's concept of happiness is called _eudaimonia_ (a loaded term that also means well-being, human flourishing, and living in a way favored by the gods) is the practice of virtues.

But what are virtues? 

Just as a dog is happiest when it is fulfilling its function: being a dog and doing dog things (e.g. playing fetch or digging as a stand-in for hunting), humans are happiest doing human things. But what does it mean for a human to be doing human things?

Aristotle argues that it is uniquely human to have reason, so reason must be part of our human function. For us to do anything well, we need virtue and excellence. Virtues are just humans practicing our reasoning so virtues are the pursuit of what it means to be human. Being virtuous and practicing virtues make us happy. It is an end in itself.

(From personal experience, I can attest that the times I was happiest were the times I was improving a lot -- I was fulfilling what I thought to be my function, and in order to do that well I needed to exercise, study, read books, practice what I read, travel to expand my horizons. This fits in with Aristotle says we build virtues by way of habit. Not merely by having virtues, but by practicing and internalizing them.) 

Aristotle provides an elegant tool to define virtues: the [Golden Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)).

Here he argues that virtues are just the mean of two vices, and vices are just extremes.

For example, having too little courage is cowardice and having too much courage is rashness. 

An example situation I came across is to imagine an old lady is being mugged. If you have too little courage, you would ignore what is happening and run away. If you have too much courage, you might rush in and try to incapacitate the mugger and save the old lady.

At first glance, it seems having too much courage is a good thing. But consider: if the mugger has a knife or a gun, or is much stronger than you, your efforts might be futile and you might just be putting yourself and the old lady in unnecessary danger. You might even make the situation worse by escalating it: the mugger might have only planned to take the old lady's purse and run but since you tried to tackle him (and maybe the old lady helps you), he pulls out his gun and shoots both you and the old lady.

A better approach would maybe be to call for help. There might be bystanders who are more capable that you could work with. Or might try calling the police on your phone.

We must use our rationality and our knowledge of ourselves and the world to find that midpoint.  

(If virtues are defined as thus and they are central to achieve _eudaimonia_ does it mean the ultimate virtue is "balance"?)

The spirit of the Golden Mean also appears in many religions and philosophies so it's very interesting that a lot of thinkers have converged on this idea:

* The myth of Daedalus and Icarus, an inscription on the temple at Delphi and Cleobulus, Socrates and Plato talked about this idea before Aristotle.
* Buddhism: Gautama Buddha: the "Middle Way"
* Judaism: Ecclesiastes 7:15-16: "be not righteous over much", "be not over much wicked"
* Christianity: Saint Thomas Aquinas: "...it is evident that moral virtue observes the mean"
* Islam: Muhammad: "the best choice is the middle ground/golden mean one"
* Hinduism: Bhagavad Gita: "Yoga is not for one who eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough."

I like this idea a lot because it always seemed to me that the Catholic virtues I was taught growing up was skewed too much to one side.

I want to be a charitable person but not have to give away all my worldly posessions and live in poverty. I want to be nice to people but not be stepped on. I want to achieve great things and not feel bad about telling people about it.

I like the idea of using reason and not some antiquated absolute rules (which restrict human freedom too much) to determine the best way to be. 

I want to live a good life in the here and now and without expectations of a posthumous award. I like that being good is an end of itself, and not just a means to reach heaven (a preqrequisite is a belief in an afterlife that cannot be proven nor disproven empirically). 

By striving to be the "best" version of yourself as defined by being virtuous (balanced and rational), you have more capacity to improve the human condition: to help more people and maybe even inspire them.
