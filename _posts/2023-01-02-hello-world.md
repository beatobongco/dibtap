It's yet another new year. Welcome 2023.

I want to dedicate this blog as a sort of pseudo-journal / blog / workout log / self-therapy / tool-to-get-my-thinking-clearer - **dibtap** is short for **D**one **I**s **B**etter **T**h**A**n **P**erfect

I have a bad tendency to overthink and procrastinate. I think it's a problem with me not wanting to start or release anything less than perfect -- probably a problem with emotional regulation, low-self esteem, impostor syndrome or all of the above. But enough about that, I promised myself I'd also work on positive self-talk too ;)

You could think of this as ramblings of one who desperately wants to get back on track on the road to self-improvement which has really catapulted my life in the past from a nobody from some third-world province to someone at least who can build lots of things.

I just want to get done what I set out to do this year - no fanfare. Not much editing if at all, typos are jsut fine (see what I did there? hehe)

Some quick background: I left 2022 in a slump. Around Q2 I had some major life events that left me out in open water, thankfully on a pretty good life-raft. 

I left a job and a startup I was really stoked about and (initially) I really believed in. I can say I gave it my all, my 110% (back then, I had the eyebags to prove it). I also could say the same for my long-term relationship -- double whammy.

I spent the latter half of 2022 recovering from that, piecing my life back together, travelling Asia for a bit -- finding what else other than work I enjoyed doing: which I quickly found to be **climbing**! I manifested both a new job and a new partner. It all sounds like I recovered pretty quickly but I can't say that's completely the case. 

I was - I might still be - in a slump. I had lost my BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) and thus my purpose. My climbing progressed quickly but stalled just as quickly - I got injured thrice: two A2 pulley tears (right middle, left ring finger), right shoulder subluxation. 

Despite the good luck of landing on my feet, I found myself lethargic and despondent, procrastinating a ton on social media.

I want 2023 to be different. 

I still dont have a BHAG just yet, but I've identified 3 main goals I have this year

1. Work on becoming a world-class generalist software engineer
2. Become an excellent climber (7a+ / V6+)
3. Achieve balance: improve in my craft + hobby while still having time to tend to important relationships 

I have some subgoals as well, most important of which is learning about real estate to build wealth.

Yes yes, it's all a bit scattered. Especially goal #1 because I want it to encompass machine learning as well, especially NLP (what with ChatGPT shaking up the world). But I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else so if you're reading this, go fish. 

Some posts that inspired me to get off my bum and write (which I might be referencing in the near future)
