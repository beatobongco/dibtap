8:35AM - Bacolod City, PH (~~S-E-MRJ~~)

Last night I hung out with my aunt and her friends. 

I have her to thank actually for getting me into tech - funnily enough my entrypoint into this world was through what was then Macromedia Flash (it has long since been acquired by Adobe).<!-- excerpt-end -->

When I was in 5th grade my aunt signed me up for a summer class on Flash and I ended up getting reasonably good at it.

I kept practicing and eventually I was able to make some money in high school when classmates would ask me to make their projects* - our computer class covered Flash for 2 years in junior and senior year. It is most likely that our computer teacher didn't really know what else she could teach us, and they were making the curriculum up on the fly. 

_*Note: I didn't offer this service, it was more that the market came to me and I happily obliged._

Growing up also my computer time was limited to 1 hour per weekend day (e.g. Saturday, Sunday) so even though I practiced animating for years and I was top of my computer class by a wide margin, I wasn't really that great from a global perspective.

This makes me think of the effects of environment - sometimes I wish I was set up in a high school where I could have learned to program earlier with peers who were interested / good at it and my parents were a bit more lenient with computer time. There's no value in regrets though, and I'm happy I still was able to find my way into the tech world - there truly is no other world I'd rather be in. 

## Environment and Habits

Andrew Huberman says that habits can be either context-dependent or context-independent. For example, brushing your teeth in the morning doesn't require you to be in a very specific place (lots of places have bathrooms / sinks) hence it is context-independent. 

Something that requires specific equipment like a climbing wall or a barbell with heavy weights is more context-dependent. 

I'm currently visiting my hometown, staying at my parent's house and it's way less equipped with the things I need vs my condo and gym in Manila.

But I'm still able to get my routine done, all I need is resourcefulness and my body for exercise.

Here's an example of what I did today:

```
12 x 3 Push ups
12 x 3 Military press (found some old dumbbells)
12 x 3 leg raises
5 seconds x 5 x 2 recruitment pulls on a portable hangboard
```

Meditation and reading can be done with my smartphone - I use a free Android app called Insight Timer and the Kindle app for reading.

Journaling just requires a notebook or a laptop.

These context-independent habits are good to keep for keeping a good baseline for physical, psychological and mental health but I do believe to achieve any serious progress in your goals you'll really need a good environment and form context-dependent habits.

I moved to Manila for college and there I really learned to program. The environment was more than 10x better than high school especially since my course was tech-related (MIS - Management Information Systems -- a fancy way to say Management + IT).

The teachers were much more knowledgeable. Some had even worked in industry or had their own consultancies or startups and I had some peers who were quite interested in programming though honestly the majority just copy/pasted other people's code. I'd say only about 10% of my coursemates were really interested.

I got a kick out of programming so much I'd do it on my own time and even cut class to just hack on a game I was making.

I also wonder the same thing - what if I had the opportunity to go to a school like Stanford or MIT? How much differently would I have turned out? 

But again there's no sense in looking back. I made the most of the resources and opportunities I had at the time. Being born in a third-world country, I'm already considered very privileged to have gone to the college I went to.

Though as we get older and our spending power increases so does our freedom. We increasingly get the chance to pick our own environments which is super important.

[Naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1390216106384584704) says the most important decisions you make in life are

* What you do (occupation / business)
* Where you live 
* Who you're with (life partner, workmates)

All those constitute environment and help shape you and your habits.

### What you do 

Your occupation / business definitely has effects on your personality and opportunities. I can't find a study related to this (though that might be an interesting endeavor). 

For example, working in tech I have the opportunity to work remotely more than people in other occupations. Working as a programmer as well might influence my behavior more towards staying indoors (getting good = deliberate practice = more screen time). If I'm an individual contributor, it might also reduce my need for social skills.

Contrast this with a person in sales where social skills are a MUST and you'd be travelling around a lot trying to close deals.

### Where you live

I've been thinking about this one a lot. 

Where you live definitely shapes you. My best friend moved to Sydney early in his working career - and he's transformed into a fit, successful person and is able to live his dreams of travelling around the world a few times a year. 

The baseline salary boost one gets from moving from a third to first world country is huge. It allows you to spend on things you would think twice about spending on before, like international travel. 

It gives you access to more competent people (for example a really good trainer or co-workers) or better facilities.

It exposes you to opportunity in your field - for example, there's no better place for tech people who want to change things than Silicon Valley.

The culture of the place and the people you meet will affect you. I imagine living in a Western country would make you less conservative and more outspoken. Hanging out with Japanese people would probably make you care more about the collective - about being polite and not bothering others.

The downside of moving as I hear from a lot of my friends who migrate is it can get lonely. And especially if you're getting on in age, it is more difficult to make friends. 

### Who you're with

According to this [graph](https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime) your partner will increasingly be the person you spend most of your time with, next to yourself.

I imagine you'll absorb a lot of that person's worldview and habits and you'll work on a lot of hard problems together e.g. raising a family if that's your thing, or perhaps starting a business. With this decision, one can afford to be super picky (but maybe not picky enough that you never end up even dating someone)

My mental model for this one is finding a co-founder for my family / for life. 

Taking the startup analogy further as well - you know how VC's invest more in the team than the idea? Via that analogy, this decision might be the most important one.

The things you do or where you live may change over time, but as the hopeless romantic I am I believe "who you're with" from a life partner perspective shouldn't.

This question also applies to friends and workmates. It's a common aphorism that you're the average of the 5 people you spend the most of your time with. So do guard who's in your innermost circle. It's OK to set high standards, and help elevate people however you can if they're open to it.

The best kinds of circles (and partners) are those who you don't just get together with purely for fun or leisure, but also to improve and succeed together.
