8:30AM - Bacolod, PH (~~S~~-~~E~~-~~M~~~~R~~~~J~~)

It's often said in self-improvement circles that habits make you who you are. I think it goes something like:

> Your thoughts influence your actions, which influence your habits, which ultimately shape your life - as you are what you do repeatedly.

Therefore, I've decided to focus on forming a good morning routine.
<!-- excerpt-end -->
When I was in my work-super-hard phase circa 2018-2020 (I was working for a regionally well-known data science consultancy with a reputation for near-burnout levels of work as part of the culture), I had this little acronym that would describe how an ideal day would go

**MRJ-SE**

It stands for

```
M - meditate
R - read (a book, a paper)
J - journal
S - study (continue an online class)
E - exercise
```

In my journal, I would write that acronym down beside the date of the entry and cross out each letter as I had gotten it done. The tasks are meant to be done in order, meaning I'd meditate before reading and read before journaling.

It would take maybe 3 hours and was really effective for my career growth - I think I did it daily for almost 2 years and finished a bunch of good online classes relevant to my work and went from zero to relatively proficient (as in I could help out or solve real problems clients faced). But I think ultimately it was unsustainable. During those 2 years I barely climbed, traveled, or hung out with friends.

Work was life and as I found out later, work is definitely **not** life.

I want to revisit that little _Habit Acronym_ technique but make it more sustainable. 

### S - Sleep 

First thing I want to focus on is sleep. A lot has been written about sleep, and I have to admit I'm still in the middle of reading [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) but I got the gist that its one of the most important things you can fix in your life because it affects everything: your mental faculties, your physical performance, emotional regulation, processing of trauma, etc, etc

So that's the first thing I want to put in my new morning routine. I want to get a solid number of hours of sleep, I think for me it works out to about 6-7. It really depends on your particular genetics and age. When left to my own devices, I think I usually wake up after around 6-7 hours provided I'm not completely exhausted the night before.

I think not having this in my old routine contributed to my burnout in 2021.

Because of my girlfriend's influence, I'm reading [The 5AM Club](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37502596-the-5-am-club). I dislike the writing style and I'm usually not into pop self-improvement BUT and this is a big BUT - the message is actually good. Sure, sure you can say "I know everything in that book already" but the fact is - do you do it? For me, it's a good reminder of what I'm supposed to be doing.

While I don't adhere to waking up exactly at 5AM because sleep is super important, and its impractical for me to go to bed at 10PM, what I'm taking from the book is I need to wake up earlier so I'm starting with the easier goal of:

> Be in bed before 12 midnight, wake up before 7am

### E - Exercise

I'm changing the order of exercise to come first. 

This is because exercising first thing in the morning gives you an energy boost - it's something [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g) talks about in his episode about forming habits.

Ideally it should be around 20 minutes of Zone 2 cardio IIRC - but since I want these habits to be context-independent (e.g. doesn't matter where in the world I am), I'll just take it to be 20 minutes of anything.

After that I'll take a quick cold shower.

I'm a notoriously slow starter in the morning - I could wake up at 7am but actually start moving at 9am, wasting 2 hours in the black hole of Twitter or, gasp, YouTube shorts (I know, I know, please hold your vomit) and I since I've been doing this I feel it gives me a psychological boost - since I've gotten my ass in gear and have done 100 kettlebell swings, and doused myself, screaming, into cold water - I might as well get to work / do my errands right after.

If you do hard or uncomfortable things early in the day, it becomes easier to do everything else.

As Huberman said, something something ["limbic friction"](https://hubermanlab.com/build-or-break-habits-using-science-based-tools/)

> Do 20 minutes of whatever workout you can manage, followed by a cold shower

### M - Meditate

Meditation was introduced to me by a mentor and dear friend sometime in 2017. It was really hard to get a hang of first since I have a super noisy mind but when I got into a consistent practice it was game-changing.

I felt more in control of my thoughts and actions and actually noticed a gap forming between what I perceived (e.g. someone doing something to piss me off) and how I reacted (I could stop myself from doing or saying anything rash). It made me have a longer fuse and I think I became a tad more patient.

It also really helped with clarity of thought - I felt like I could get out of bad-thought loops and think clearly about problems I was solving, or directionally where I wanted to go in life.

My practice is a mess currently. I used to be able to sit for 20 minutes daily, no problem but now 10 is a struggle.

But you know what they say: if you fall off, just get back on the horse.

> Meditate at least 10 minutes every day

### R - Read

Books are awesome. Its like receiving transmissions of knowledge from across space and time from the smartest humans who ever lived.

I'm ashamed to admit that I... stopped reading in 2022. 

I feel reading is what elevated me out of my humble beginnings in the first place. I basically feel I have reading to credit for inspiring most of whatever success I may have -- story for another time -- so it feels like a betrayal.

The first half of 2022 I was literally working on both ends of the candle. I'd have meetings as early as 8 or 9am and as late as 2am (I'm in the Asian timezone, I worked for a US startup - go figure). The second half I was "finding myself" travelling and letting out my 2 years worth of repressed feelings for climbing -- but excuses no more in 2023! And I now work within my own timezone! 

I want to get back into the habit of reading books -  but again, I want to start light so for now and make this context-independent so I'll allow good **long-form** articles about relevant subjects - basically anything I wouldn't be ashamed to classify as having good knowledge content.

> Read something with high knowledge value everyday, preferably a book

### J - Journal

Writing is thoughts on paper - how you write is how you think - so if you want to improve your thinking journaling is a no-brainer.

I think this goes hand-in-hand with meditation - both improve clarity of thought.

Just like meditation, I have done this semi-consistently over the years and it has really helped. Especially when going through tough spots in life, it's like having a shrink that never gets tired of listening. Dumping your bad feelings on paper allows you to not bring that energy into the world, while dumping your creative thoughts on paper does the opposite - it increases the chance you'll actually go create something since you've thought out a bit of the steps to make it happen.

> Write at least a sentence every day

I want to commit to writing a little every day - it could be through this blog (it somehow motivates me more when I write something that maybe even one other person may read) or through my analog journal (for daily planning and more personal stuff)

I want to commit to writing imperfectly and want to resist the temptation to edit too much so I actually get posts out there. It's like a form of therapy and a mental exercise to be OK with just releasing imperfect things into the wild - I think mastering this will really make me a better person on many fronts - after all, done is better than perfect.

All in all, this routine takes around 2 hours max. A little longer if I take too long writing this blog post. Expect some shorter ones in the future too!
